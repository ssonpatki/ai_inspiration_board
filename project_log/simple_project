templates/index.html -> Frontend, user interface

static/styles.css -> Custom styles (CSS or Tailwind) for UI/UX


-> LLM/NLP in this Project <-

User Input -> Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model:
    - User types a topic in the form
    - Flask sends it as a prompt to the GPT model (distilgpt2)

Prompting the Large Language Model (LLM):
    - Use line prompt to instruct the LLM
    - LLM uses language knowledge to generate relevant text/response

Text Generation:
    - Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model generates human-like text: a summary and suggested tasks
    - NLP in action, using a large pretrained model to understand and generate human language

Display Output:
    - Flask passes the generated text back to the frontend
    - Users see AI-powered suggestions on their “Inspiration Board”
